This is a 2 player game called Catch Phrase
Player 1 starts the game.
Player 1 will sees 5 partial popular phrases flash on screen and they have to finish the phrase by typing in the answer.
Each question is worth 10 points
After both players answer 5 questions, it will give the winner based on a score best out of 5 


JAVASCRIPT
I used Javascript to create an array of objects for all of the catchPhrases with their matching answers. I used prompts with "if" statements to select the catchPhrases with their matching answer. If the questions was answered correctly then it will add 10 points to the score.

CSS
I used two key frames for the title on the page in my CSS.
